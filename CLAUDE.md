# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a static website for Richmond's Alumni Charity Challenge, built with Eleventy (11ty) v2.0.1. The site is a single-page application that showcases an annual charity event established in 2013 by the VCU Alumni Richmond Chapter.

## Development Commands

**Start development server:**
```bash
npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
```

This will build the site and start a local server with live reload.

**Build site:**
```bash
npx @11ty/eleventy
```

The built site outputs to the `_site/` directory.

## Architecture

### Build System

The project uses Eleventy with a minimal configuration in [.eleventy.js](.eleventy.js):

- **HTML Minification**: All HTML files are automatically minified via the `htmlmin` transform using `html-minifier`
- **CSS Minification**: A `cssmin` filter is available for inline CSS using `clean-css`
- **Static Asset Passthrough**: `bundle.css` and `main.js` are copied directly to output without processing

### Site Structure

This is a **single-page website** with all content in [index.html](index.html). The architecture is:

- **Main content file**: `index.html` - Contains all page sections (about, history, recognition, participants, leadership, calendar, sponsors)
- **Reusable partials**: `_includes/_header.html` and `_includes/_footer.html` - Header navigation and footer are included as partials
- **Static assets**: `bundle.css`, `bundle.js`, and various assets in `_site/` directory
- **Output directory**: `_site/` - Generated by Eleventy, contains the built static site

### Frontend Framework

- **Bootstrap 3.3.7**: Used for layout and responsive design via CDN
- **jQuery 1.12.4**: Legacy dependency for Bootstrap functionality
- **Font Awesome**: Icon library loaded via kit
- **Navigation**: Single-page navigation using anchor links (e.g., `#about`, `#participants`)

### Key Implementation Details

1. **Includes are manually embedded**: The header and footer partials in `_includes/` need to be manually inserted into `index.html` - Eleventy doesn't automatically process them unless explicitly referenced

2. **JavaScript loading**: Footer uses an inline script that includes the built main.js file:
   ```javascript
   {% include "../_site/js/main.js" %};
   ```

3. **Year updates**: The site is updated annually. When updating for a new year:
   - Update copyright year in footer
   - Update donation links (currently pointing to FeedMore.org)
   - Update meta descriptions and Open Graph tags
   - Update image assets in `img/YEAR/` directory

4. **No build tooling**: CSS and JS are pre-bundled files (`bundle.css`, `bundle.js`, `main.js`). There's no webpack, rollup, or similar build process for these assets.
