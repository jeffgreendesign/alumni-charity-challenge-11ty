<h1>AGENTS.md - Alumni Charity Challenge Website</h1><p>This file provides guidance for AI agents working on this codebase.</p><h2>Animation System (GSAP)</h2><p>A JavaScript-based animation system using GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) has been implemented to enhance the user experience with modern, lightweight animations.</p><ul><li><strong>Core Library</strong>: GSAP (Core and ScrollTrigger plugin) is loaded via CDN in <code>_includes/_footer.html</code>.</li><li><strong>Custom Animations</strong>: All custom animation logic resides in <code>js/animations.js</code>. This file is included in <code>_includes/_footer.html</code> and copied to the <code>_site/js/</code> directory during the Eleventy build process (see <code>.eleventy.js</code>).</li><li><strong>Documentation</strong>: Detailed instructions for adding or modifying animations are included as comments at the end of <code>js/animations.js</code>.</li><li><strong>Performance</strong>: Animations prioritize CSS transforms and opacity. ScrollTrigger is used for lazy-loading animations that trigger on scroll.</li><li><strong>Accessibility</strong>: A <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code> media query check is implemented in <code>js/animations.js</code>. If a user has this preference set, most animations will be disabled or significantly reduced, and elements will be set to their final states.</li><li><strong>jQuery Interaction</strong>: The animation code is designed to be independent of the existing jQuery code in <code>main.js</code>.</li></ul><p><strong>When working with animations:</strong></p><ul><li>Refer to the documentation in <code>js/animations.js</code> for guidelines on creating new animations.</li><li>Ensure new animations also respect the <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code> setting.</li><li>Test thoroughly on desktop and mobile, paying attention to performance and potential conflicts.</li><li>Keep animations purposeful and avoid overly complex or distracting effects.</li></ul><h2>General</h2><ul><li>The site is built using Eleventy (11ty).</li><li>Bootstrap 3.3.7 is used for styling and layout.</li><li>Custom CSS is in <code>bundle.css</code>.</li><li>Main page template is <code>index.html</code>.</li><li>Partials are in <code>_includes/</code>.</li><li>Existing JavaScript (primarily jQuery plugins and site interactions) is in <code>main.js</code> (sourced from <code>_site/js/main.js</code> via an include in <code>_includes/_footer.html</code>).</li></ul>
